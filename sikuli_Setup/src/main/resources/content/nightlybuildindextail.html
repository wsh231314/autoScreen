<b>fixed:</b> ObserverCallback did not work in JRuby<br>
<a href="https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/pull/191">(thanks to https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/pull/191)</a><br>

where the image was captured from<br>
<b>revised:</b> Python API layer for use with IDE's like PyCharm,
class Screen is now directly mapped to class Screen at Java API<br>

<b>revised:</b> Mac: App.isRunning() more robust now (no more strange crashes)<br>
<b>added:</b> popFile(): display a file open dialog allowing to select a file or folder
returning the absolute path to the selected item (Mac: script packages .sikuli can be entered)<br>
<b>revised:</b> the open/save/loadImage dialogs - Jython scripting support: <br>
... now possible to open a folder not having .sikuli (save not yet supported)<br>
... .skl can be opened to a .sikuli, to edit the script <br>
<b>fixed:</b> run(someCommand) now prints the complete output from stderr 
(not only first line) (Bug #1573519)<br>
<b>revised:</b> The target parameter type in find, wait, exists,findAll and onXXX is now checked for validity.<br>
... same goes for the respective indirect finds in click, ... (valid only: single Pattern, String, Image)<br>
... If invalid the script aborts with an error message reporting the line number in Jython scripts.<br>
<b>added:</b> class App: experimental: issue http requests based on Apache org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient 
(App.wwwStart(), App.wwwStop(), App.wwwGet(), App.wwwSave() see javadocs)<br>
<b>added:</b> FindFailed handler support: it is now possible, to define a handler function (as with observe), 
that is visited in case of FindFailed situations (before any other actions). 
A handler might also be specified for situations, that an image is not found on the imagepath (not loadable).
This new feature allows much easier, to implement corrective actions and logging for these cases.
How to finally handle the case can be specified in the handler. (see docs: Exception FindFailed)<br>
<b>revised:</b> FindFailed PROMPT: now an image can be recaptured in case of not found. This might make it easier, 
to make a script work in changed environments, where images are no longer found. 
The original image is preserved as _BACKUP_original.png. 
These backups have to be managed manually at this time and 
are overwritten without notice with the next recapture<br>
<b>added:</b> input and pop... features can now be placed on the screen where needed 
(center of the dialogbox goes to a given location or center of a region - 
related function is popat())<br>
<b>revised:</b> input, popup and the other pop... features now are always on top 
from beginning no matter which app is frontmost<br>
<b>revised:</b> Jython scripting support: possible now to setup a folder 
myscript (no .sikuli needed) containing a myscript.py, other .py files to be imported
and folders .sikuli intended to contain images.<br>
... This allows to setup projects in IDE's like PyCharm and 
run them from PyCharm as well as using SikuliX from commandline. <br>
... The image folders .sikuli are intended to be managed in the SikuliX IDE (capture support).<br>
About the prerequisites and the possibilities see the docs. 
This folder structure is not yet completely supported in the SikuliX IDE.

added: Jython support: now Lib/site-packages is recognized
and can have a sites.txt containing more paths (see docs/Using Python)
<h4>Build: 2015-06-22</h4>
revised: commandfiles on Mac to have alternatives to start the IDE (shows SikuliX icon in taskbar and SikuliX as name)<br>
revised: App class on Mac, still App.open() (app not running)
does not work on 10.9 and earlier (on 10.10 with most apps works),
when the script is run from the IDE that is running as SikuliX.app
- when starting the IDE or running script from commandline it works<br>
<h4>Build: 2015-06-15</h4>
fixed: Windows: Jython scripting: exceptions in imported stuff now again shown correctly
<h4>Build: 2015-05-28</h4>

if other means are used to start the app (usage instead of "if someApp.window()")
<h4>Build: 2015-05-22</h4>
revised: class App: App.open() and openApp() now ignore already running instances of the named app and will in doubt start a new instance.
Windows: openApp("cmd.exe /c "some command to run") works again

fixed: App.getWindow(): Mac: a problem with , in a title<br>
continued: RunServer and RunClient (now named Run)
<h4>Build: 2015-05-16</h4>
fixed: IDE: cursor keeps current position in cases, where the content is re-evaluated (toggle view and image rename)<br>
added: experimental (more options might follow):
a feature to highlight the search region before search (green frame)
and the match (if found, red frame) after the search (each for 2 seconds),
might be an alternative to slow motion running. Start: Debug.highlightOn(), Stop: Debug.highlightOff().
works for region.method() usage and for setROI() usage. The region/ROI must be at least 10 pixel smaller
than the screen on all sides, otherwise the green frame is omitted.
<h4>Build: 2015-05-15</h4>
fixed: multi monitor: should be fixed now (tested on Mac (incl. 10.10.x) and on Windows)<br>
revised: IDE: show button: now recognizes negative coordinates and finds image on all screens.<br>
added: class App: now possible to add parameters/options again as a string using setUsing(...). <br>
Currently only recognized on Windows, which brings back the possibility to <br>
open an application with parameters/options. <br>
Until now: App.open("some.exe parm1 parm2 ...") <br>
must now be written as App("some.exe").setUsing("parm1 parm2 ...").open()
<h4>Build: 2015-05-13</h4>
revised: class App: Mac/Windows: an app now knows it's process ID (PID) and its frontmost window title<br>
you can ask an app wether it is running and wether it has a window<br>
if an app is running it is not started again with open(). Linux: not yet revised
<h4>Build: 2015-05-08</h4>
revised: class App: App.open, focus, close on Windows to be more consistent.
getWindow() to get the title of the frontmost window of an app. The same app is only opened once -
a running process is reused.
<h4>Build: 2015-05-04</h4>
temp fix: IDE as mac app: added a hack to avoid click/type slowdown after about 60 seconds<br>
temp fixed: IDE: switching to Jython 2.7.0 final with setup option for Jython 2.5 (when unicode problems arise)
<h4>Build: 2015-05-01</h4>
added: IDE: buttons to capture a point and an offset and <br>
to show (highlight) the leftmost item in the line having the cursor (if possible in the line context)<br>
added: IDE: capturing with the cursor in a line containing only imagename = will result in an<br>
image filename as imagename.png and overwrites on recapture. (to support naming schemes and variable use)
<h4>Build: 2015-04-23</h4>
fixed: setup did not work anymore with already downloaded artefacts (offline setup)<br>
added: runScript(): inline run of PowerShell snippets
<h4>Build: 2015-04-20</h4>
added: runScript("applescript tell ..."): run code snippets in AppleScript on Mac using osascript<br>
fixed: possible problem with setup running with proxy<br>
revised: running Python scripts from net and with RunServer<br>
revised runsikulix.cmd: now first we check, whether java can be run from system path<br>
fixed: each SikuliX session should have it's own temp folder (auto deleted at JVM shutdown).
Still the IDE GUI can only run once, but as much as one likes in parallel from commandline.
<h4>Build: 2015-04-17</h4>
fixed: user args after -- not filled into sys.argv when running from commandline<br>
fixed: runsikulix.cmd did not use Java 8, if available in standard places<br>
fixed: tessdata not bundled when using setup with option 1 only<br>
fixed: exists(Pattern(image)) hangs (internally looping endlessly), if image file is not available<br>
added: experimental: RunServer: run scripts (or JavaScript snippets) from anywhere using a http RESTful protocol<br>
fixed: save script problems causing exceptions should be handled internally (otherwise might block GUI)<br>
added: experimental: visual annotation (former extension Guide) now a standard feature of SikuliX (contained in sikulixapi.jar)
<h4>Build: 2015-04-03</h4>
fixed: runScript(): possible NPE, when used in scripts run from commandline
<h4>Build: 2015-04-01</h4>
revised: jython script running with sikulixapi.jar::Runner: now returns the value from an exit(n)<br>
fixed: Linux: possible NPE in build on the fly
<h4>Build: 2015-03-31</h4>
added: jython script running with sikulixapi.jar::Runner: usage: org.sikuli.script.Runner.run(scriptPath, args),
sikulixapi.jar and a jython.jar must be on classpath (auto taken from setup downloads if omitted).
<h4>Build: 2015-03-27</h4>
fixed: Mac: a problem that made it to not run any longer with Java 6<br>
revised: MouseMovedCallback feature<br>
added: set callback handler and request visiting the handler before processing a mouse action (on/off)<br>
added: request termination with next mouse action throwing an AssertionError
<h4>Build: 2015-03-24</h4>
fixed: (I hope ;-) all regression bugs against 1.0.1 in multi monitor environments<br>
revised: ALL in Jython scripts and Screen.all().getRegion() can now be used, to search on all monitors in the same op
(ALL.click(someBotton) will find and click the button, no matter on which monitor it currently is)
<h4>Build: 2015-03-24</h4>
added: multi monitor: a visual can now be found on all screens with one op: Screen.all().getRegion().find(someImage)
will return a match, that knows it's screen, hence match.getScreen() will return the screen it was found on.
Take care: is a lengthy operation and costs some memory, so it should be used with care.
If the match spans screens, the screen with the biggest part is the winner (should be avoided).
<h4>Build: 2015-03-22</h4>
the next days I will somehow reveal more information about the new or revised features<br>
... but many features are already in the docs<br>
<br>
a toy: starting sikulixapi.jar with no parameters reveals a simple edit/save/run dialog for JavaScript trials<br>
added: SikulixAppData/SikulixStore/SikulixDebug.txt if this file is present at startup, then from beginning
we run with debug level 3 and all messages are written to this file (helpful for startup debugging)<br>
added: SikulixAppData/SikulixStore/SikulixOptions.txt is a key/value store according
to the rules of Java property files, that is loaded at startup. The options might overwrite settings
and are available at runtime via getOption... calls (precedence: home folder, work dir, SikulixAppData)<br>
added: SikuliX now has a central repository (SikulixAppData) for all related stuff
in the user's home folder area according according to the standards of the system<br>
added: running scripts can now be paused/continued and aborted by moving the mouse
(detection with next mouse action)<br>
added: one can now run scripts written in JavaScript (edit not yet supported in IDE)<br>
revised: script running in general: -r can have multiple scripts that are run one after the other,<br>
added: runScript() can be used to run scripts from inside other scripts or from Java
including handling of the bundlePath<br>

can be exported or used from the .exe content (bundled in the original jars)<br>
revised: moved parts of the Sikuli/Jython import handler to the Java level<br>
revised: completely reworked the startup for IDE and API usage, now concentrating all startup requirements in the one
singleton class RunTime<br>
revised: all Sikulix related stuff besides the jars (setup, IDE and API, can now be moved around freely)
is now in a system specific Sikulix folder in the home folder<br>
